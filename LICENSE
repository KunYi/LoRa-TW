CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this strongly reciprocal
variant, the weakly reciprocal variant and the permissive variant.
You may use this licence under the terms of either variant.

The CERN-OHL-S is a strong copyleft licence. This means that if you
redistribute designs based on this licensed material, or products
using it, you must distribute the complete source for those
derivatives under the same licence.

1 Definitions

1.1 ‘Licence’ means this CERN-OHL-S.

1.2 ‘Source’ means information such as design materials or
documentation which can be used to make or test a Product or to
prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of the form
or medium in which it is expressed. It includes schematics,
hardware description language (HDL) files, board layouts, bill of
materials, manufacturing files, and descriptive documentation.

1.3 ‘Product’ means any device or physical implementation of the
Licensed Material, or substantial part thereof.

1.4 ‘Licensed Material’ means any Source distributed under this
Licence.

1.5 ‘Modification’ means any change to the Licensed Material,
including without limitation, addition to or deletion from the
substance or structure of the Licensed Material, or translation into
another language or into another format.

1.6 ‘Derivative’ means any work, whether in Source or Product form,
that is based on or derived from the Licensed Material or from a
Modification.

1.7 ‘Convey’ means to communicate or make available by any means,
including without limitation by physical delivery, communication to

non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, in
Source and Product form, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Licensed Material to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted.
