# LoRa-TW

**LoRa-TW** is a hardware project designed in **KiCAD** targeting LoRa applications in the Taiwan frequency band(AS923, 920MHz ~ 925MHz).
The design is based on the **Semtech SX1262** transceiver, optimized for robust operation in noisy RF environments.

## Project Purpose
This project aims to provide a reliable LoRa module reference design for Taiwan (center frequency **922.5 MHz**).
To improve receiver robustness, an external **SAW filter** is introduced in the RX path to mitigate interference from nearby cellular communication bands.

## Key Features
- **RF Core**: Semtech SX1262
- **T/R Switch**: PSemi RF switch
- **Filtering**: QUALCOMM SAW filter (optimized for 922.5 MHz center frequency)
- **Powering**: DC-DC mode operation
- **Form Factor**: 12-pin 2.0mm breakout for easy integration
